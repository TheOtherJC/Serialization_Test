# Synopsis


**Pickle**
   * Pickle serialises the object first before writing it to a file, which seems to very useful for what we're trying to do.
   
**Protobuf**
   * Protobuf doesn't deal with schema evolution which would cause most to assume it would be more efficient, yet is the least efficient out of the three choices.
    
**MsgPack**
   * Msgpack can distinguish string and binary type, yet it doesn't work well with Python 2 which could be a hindrance. However it does produce the shortest string length and is the quickest out the three.

# Installation
**Pickle:**

`import pickle`

**Protobuf:**

`$ sudo pip3 install protobuf`

`syntax = "proto2"`

**MsgPack:**

`$ sudo pip install msgpack-python`

`import msgpack`
# Results

**Pickle:**

```bash
def writeReadPkl():
    serializedPkl = pickle.dumps(realStuff, protocol=2)
    print ('pickle string length: %s'%len(serializedPkl))
    rslt = pickle.loads(serializedPkl)
    return rslt

setupStatement="""\
from __main__ import writeReadPkl, realStuff
"""

print ('writeRead:  %s' % timeit.timeit("writeReadPkl()", setup=setupStatement, number=10))
```
output:

* pickle string length: 26798577
* writeRead:  4.851042742000573

**Protobuf:**

```bash def writeReadPB():
    bOTD = BunchOfTestDicts()
    for thisDict in realStuff:
        tD = bOTD.dicts.add()
        for k, v in thisDict.items():
            pair = tD.pairs.add()
            pair.key = k
            pair.value = v
    #serializedPB = bOTD.SerializeToString()
    #print 'serialized PB length: %s'%len(serializedPB)
    #newBOTD = BunchOfTestDicts()
    #newBOTD.ParseFromString(serializedPB)
    newBOTD = bOTD
    thisDictList = [{thisPair.key: thisPair.value
                             for thisPair in thisBufferedDict.pairs}
                    for thisBufferedDict in newBOTD.dicts]
    return thisDictList


with open('realstuff.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    realStuff = pickle.load(f)

setupStatement="""\
from __main__ import writePB, readPB, writeReadPB, realStuff
"""
```
output:
* writeRead:  22.001606503999938

**MsgPack:**

```bash
def writeReadMSG():
    serializedMSG = msgpack.dumps(realStuff)
    print ('MsgPack length: %s'%len(serializedMSG))
    rslt = msgpack.loads(serializedMSG)
    return rslt

setupStatement="""\
from __main__ import writeReadMSG
